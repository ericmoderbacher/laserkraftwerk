# laserkraftwerk
boilerplate capture for helios laser dacs and ilda lasers


## Introduction
This repo will serve as my notes and workspace as I figure out how I will control ilda laser light show projectors.

For development, I have 3 purchased products:
- [Helios laser DAC ](https://bitlasers.com/helios-laser-dac/)
- ["Full Color Animation Laser Projector DJ Light ILDA Stage Laser Beam Light 3W RGB"](https://www.ebay.com/itm/375601920233)
- ["20Kpps speed Laser Galvo laser sets Galvanometer Based Optical Scanning speed Including Show Card for stage Animation Laser lights"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IZPMUPO)

## repo directory
- README.md
  - (you are here.)
- /helios_dac
  - a git submodule pointing to my fork of https://github.com/Grix/helios_dac. Pointing to your own fork is my recommendation.




# todo:
figureout paint and screen
paint screen
get laser
get uv diodes
get ilda controler
get beam combining prisms

write library to control projector

draw circle
draw square
draw spiral
draw spiralgraph
animate circle
draw concentric circles
mask out circles for CGoL

model the galvo parts
design the enclosure and diode mounts with prisms

integrate audio triggers

pick better grid/cell size

shape path better / merge flowing spiral and game of life.

add fuse to diy laser
pack my extra fuse kit in day-of bag

# things that might still be in scope:
figure out a lens so projector can be further away... or angle adjust so laser can be lower.
tempo matching

# things that are no longer in scope.

overhead mount of either screen or projector.
3d audio source detection / cross correlation
